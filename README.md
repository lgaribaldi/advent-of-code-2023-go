## Lgaribaldi's Advent of Code 2023

This marks my first attempt at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about), a set of programming puzzles. I don't usually take on code challenges, so I'm a bit rusty. However, since I've been learning Go these past few months, I thought this would be a good way to make myself to put some skills into practice. I had to traverse graphs, memoize results, and do some linear algebra. Overall, I am happy with the results, even though a couple of the challenges are incomplete for now (I might try them again).

Initially, I thought I would reuse many utility functions throughout the challenge, but in the end, I had to reuse very little. The code structure ended up not being the best; if I do it again next year, I will think of something different, perhaps a module for each day.
